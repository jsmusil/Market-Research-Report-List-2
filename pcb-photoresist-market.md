<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PCB photoresist market is divided into two types: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist is a type of photoresist that becomes more soluble when exposed to light, allowing the exposed areas to be removed during development. On the other hand, negative photoresist becomes less soluble when exposed to light, causing the unexposed areas to be removed during development. Both types are crucial in the PCB manufacturing process to create precise circuit patterns on the substrate.</p></p>
