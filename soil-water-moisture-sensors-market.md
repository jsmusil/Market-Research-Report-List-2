<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Water Moisture Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soil Water Potential</li><li>Volumetric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soil water moisture sensors can be divided into two main types: soil water potential sensors and volumetric sensors. Soil water potential sensors measure the energy state of water in the soil, indicating the force needed to extract water from the soil. Volumetric sensors, on the other hand, measure the actual amount or volume of water present in the soil. Both types of sensors are crucial for monitoring soil moisture levels and helping farmers optimize irrigation practices for crop growth.</p></p>
