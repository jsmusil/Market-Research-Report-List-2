<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Sinks for Electronic Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Heat Sinks</li><li>Passive Heat Sinks</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active heat sinks for electronic equipment consist of a fan or pump that actively removes heat from the device, allowing for more efficient cooling. This type of heat sink is often used in high-performance systems that generate a significant amount of heat. On the other hand, passive heat sinks rely on natural convection or thermal conductivity to dissipate heat without any additional power source. They are commonly used in lower-power applications where noise and energy consumption are a concern. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining the proper operating temperature of electronic devices.</p></p>
