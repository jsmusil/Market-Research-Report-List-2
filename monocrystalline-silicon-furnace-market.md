<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monocrystalline Silicon Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Czochralski(CZ) Method Furnace</li><li>Floating Zone(FZ) Method Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Monocrystalline Silicon Furnace market includes two main types: Czochralski (CZ) Method Furnace and Floating Zone (FZ) Method Furnace. CZ Method Furnace utilizes a rotating crucible to pull a single crystal from molten silicon, resulting in high-quality monocrystalline silicon ingots. On the other hand, FZ Method Furnace uses a radiofrequency heating coil to melt and solidify a rod of silicon without any contact with a crucible, producing even higher purity silicon crystals. Both methods are crucial in the production of advanced semiconductor materials.</p></p>
