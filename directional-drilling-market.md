<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Directional Drilling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deviated Well Directional Drilling</li><li>Horizontal Well Directional Drilling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Directional drilling market includes deviated well directional drilling and horizontal well directional drilling. Deviated well directional drilling involves drilling a well at an angle to reach a specific target underground. This method is commonly used when the target is located away from the vertical wellbore. Horizontal well directional drilling involves drilling a well horizontally to access a larger surface area of a reservoir. This method is used to increase production rates and optimize reservoir drainage. Both methods are vital in oil and gas exploration and production.</p></p>
