<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Two Way Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting Electric Two Way Valve</li><li>Pilot Operated Electric Two Way Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct acting electric two way valves are operated directly by an electric actuator to control the flow of a fluid in a system. They are simple to install and operate, making them ideal for applications where quick response and precise control are needed. Pilot operated electric two way valves, on the other hand, use a smaller pilot valve to control the main valve, allowing for more precise regulation of flow rates and pressures. They are often used in larger systems where higher flow rates are required.</p></p>
