<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RJ45 Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded</li><li>Unshielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RJ45 connectors are commonly categorized into shielded and unshielded types based on their construction and design. Shielded connectors are designed with an additional layer of shielding to protect against electromagnetic interference, making them more suitable for environments with high levels of interference. On the other hand, unshielded connectors do not have this additional layer of protection but are still widely used in less demanding environments. Both types cater to different market needs, with shielded connectors being preferred for more critical applications.</p></p>
