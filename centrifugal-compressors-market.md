<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage Centrifugal Compressors</li><li>Multi-stage Centrifugal Compressors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal compressors are categorized into two main types: single-stage and multi-stage. Single-stage centrifugal compressors have one impeller that compresses the gas to the desired pressure in a single step. On the other hand, multi-stage centrifugal compressors have multiple impellers in series, each one further compressing the gas before it moves on to the next impeller. Multi-stage compressors are typically used for applications requiring higher pressure ratios or where energy efficiency is a concern.</p></p>
