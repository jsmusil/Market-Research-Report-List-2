<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zero Velocity Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Barrel End Type</li><li>Flange End Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zero Velocity Valves, also known as check valves, come in two main types - barrel end type and flange end type. Barrel end type valves are typically installed at the end of pipelines where they prevent backflow by closing when the flow stops. On the other hand, flange end type valves are mounted between pipeline flanges and operate in a similar manner. Both types of valves are essential for maintaining fluid flow control and preventing damage to equipment and processes.</p></p>
