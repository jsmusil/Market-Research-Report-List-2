<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Denitration Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cellular</li><li>Flat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial denitration catalyst market can be categorized into two main types: cellular and flat. Cellular catalysts are structured as a honeycomb-like grid, allowing for a higher surface area for reaction processes. On the other hand, flat catalysts have a simpler, flat shape that provides a more uniform distribution of reactants. However, cellular catalysts are typically more efficient in promoting the denitration process due to their increased surface area. Both types play a crucial role in reducing harmful emissions from industrial processes.</p></p>
