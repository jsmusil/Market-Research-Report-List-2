<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro Silica Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Densified Micro Silica</li><li>Semi Densified Micro Silica</li><li>Undensified Micro Silica</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Micro silica, also known as silica fume, is a byproduct of producing silicon metal or ferrosilicon alloys. There are three main types of micro silica on the market: densified, semi-densified, and undensified. Densified micro silica is more compact and has a higher density, making it easier to handle and transport. Semi-densified micro silica falls in between densified and undensified in terms of density and handling. Undensified micro silica is the least compact and requires careful handling to prevent loss during transportation.</p></p>
