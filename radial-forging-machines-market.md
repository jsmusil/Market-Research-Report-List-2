<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial Forging Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Forging</li><li>Cold Forging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial forging machines are used in both hot forging and cold forging processes. In hot forging, the material is heated to a high temperature before being forged, allowing for easier deformation and shaping of the metal. Cold forging, on the other hand, does not involve heating the material and relies on the use of extreme force to shape the metal. Both processes offer unique advantages and are used in various industries for producing a wide range of components with different properties.</p></p>
