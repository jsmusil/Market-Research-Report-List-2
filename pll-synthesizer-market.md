<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PLL Synthesizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Integer-N</li><li>Fractional-N</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PLL synthesizers are commonly used in communication systems to generate stable and precise frequencies. There are two main types of PLL synthesizers: Integer-N and Fractional-N. Integer-N synthesizers only allow for integer values in the division ratio, leading to limited frequency resolution. On the other hand, Fractional-N synthesizers allow for a wider range of division ratios, providing higher frequency resolution. Fractional-N synthesizers are more complex and expensive to design and implement, but offer better performance in terms of phase noise and spurious signals.</p></p>
