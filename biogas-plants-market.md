<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas plants use biodegradable organic materials to produce biogas, a renewable energy source. Wet digestion is a type of biogas plant that processes liquid organic waste in a wet environment, such as food waste and manure. Dry digestion, on the other hand, processes solid organic waste in a dry environment, such as agricultural residues and crop waste. Both types of biogas plants have their own market segments, with wet digestion being more suitable for liquid waste management and dry digestion for solid waste management.</p></p>
