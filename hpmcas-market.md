<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HPMCAS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Viscosity</li><li>High Viscosity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HPMCAS is a pharmaceutical polymer that comes in two market types based on viscosity: Low Viscosity and High Viscosity. Low Viscosity HPMCAS is ideal for use in immediate-release dosage forms as it rapidly dissolves in the stomach. High Viscosity HPMCAS, on the other hand, is more suitable for sustained-release or extended-release formulations due to its slower dissolution rate. Both market types offer flexibility in formulating oral solid dosage forms and are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for their controlled-release properties.</p></p>
