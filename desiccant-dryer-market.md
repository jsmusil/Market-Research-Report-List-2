<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desiccant Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heated Dryer</li><li>Heatless Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heated dryers are a type of desiccant dryer that uses heat to remove moisture from the air. This process involves heating the desiccant material to regenerate its drying capacity. On the other hand, heatless dryers do not require external heat sources and instead use the compressed air itself to regenerate the desiccant material. Heatless dryers are more energy-efficient but have a slower drying process compared to heated dryers. Both types of desiccant dryers are commonly used in industrial applications to remove moisture from compressed air systems.</p></p>
